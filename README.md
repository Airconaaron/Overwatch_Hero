# project

Overwatch Hero Picker built with Vue. Currently the reccomendations are all crap because the numbers are all randomized. This was a concept for a UI I was designing.

## Build Setup
You'll need npm or yarn to run this.
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
